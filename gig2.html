    <h1>Philip Holm. Tailor's Fiddle</h1>
    <img src="PhilipHolm.jpg" alt="PhilipHolm" width="600">
    <p>Philip Holm (1987) is the band leader of Barlast and member of groups such as Oiro Pena and Buko Shane. 
        He performs regulary on the double bass, electric bass and his experimental instruments both in Finland and abroad.
    </p>  
    <p>
        Tailor's fiddle - a unique instrument built out of an old sewing machine. 
        The music is both meditative and aggresive, drawing inspiration from folk music, sound art and noise. 
        All but one track are completely acoustic and recorded without overdubs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The tailor's fiddle is similar to the hurdy gurdy in the sense that it has a wheel rubbing against the strings. 
        However, on the tailor's fiddle, when the wheel turns, the sewing needle also moves up and down. 
        To complete the circle from sound production to reproduction, the album is released on vinyl only. 
        The spinning wheel and needle of the record player reproduce the sounds that the mechanics of the sewing machine originally produced.
